# Advent of Code 2024

## Day 1

### Thinks to think about:
 - There exist maps (Use Data.Map.Lazy, import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map)
 - Should probably implement a column parser

Day one has a alot of pissy implementations, especially part 2(see bullet point 1).
If it is not already fixed i will try to fix it soon

## Day 2 

### Things to think about:
 - Forgot that function can call function in part 2
 - learnt how to use any

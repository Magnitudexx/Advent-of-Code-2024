# Advent of Code 2024
Hey, Welcome to my GitHub page for Advent of Code 2024, your only stop for questionable solutions in Haskell. If you are just starting AoC of any year and need some tooling, feel free to check out the files in `src/` folder. Cant garantee the quality but it does the job. I am in no way an expert so if you find an improvement to the tooling or solutions feel free to tell me or branch/pull request it. I would love to learn.

## Thinks to think about:
 - There exist maps (Use Data.Map.Lazy, import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map)
 - Should probably implement a column parser
 - This repo has a custom 2D Map
## Solutions
| Day   | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Day 1 | Done   | Done   |   
| Day 2 | Done   | Done   |
### Day 1
Day one has a alot of pissy implementations, especially part 2(see bullet point 1).
If it is not already fixed i will try to fix it soon

### Day 2
